# ⚠️ Codespace Recovery Required

## Current Situation
Your codespace is currently running on Alpine Linux instead of the intended Debian-based environment. This happened because the original R feature installation failed during container creation.

## What Happened
1. The devcontainer tried to install R using `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/r:1`
2. The R feature installation failed (permission/network issue)
3. GitHub Codespaces created a recovery container using Alpine Linux
4. Alpine Linux doesn't have the same package ecosystem as Debian

## ✅ Solution: Rebuild Container

### Option 1: Full Container Rebuild (Recommended)
1. **In VS Code Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):
   - Type: `Codespaces: Rebuild Container`
   - Select the option and confirm
   - Wait for the rebuild to complete (5-10 minutes)

### Option 2: Create New Codespace
If rebuild fails:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Delete the current codespace
4. Create a new codespace

## 🔧 What's Been Fixed
- Removed the problematic R feature from devcontainer.json
- Added R installation to the setup script instead
- Updated paths and configurations for better compatibility
- Added diagnostic tools for troubleshooting

## ✅ After Rebuild
Run this command to verify everything is working:
```bash
bash scripts/diagnose_environment.sh
```

You should see:
- ✅ Python with pandas, numpy, jupyter
- ✅ R with essential packages
- ✅ PostgreSQL running
- ✅ All expected directories

## 📚 Educational Context
This is actually a great learning experience about:
- Container orchestration and recovery
- Development environment dependencies
- Troubleshooting containerized applications
- The difference between Alpine and Debian Linux distributions

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?
1. Check the creation log for new errors
2. Try the manual installation commands in the diagnosis output
3. Contact your instructor with the diagnosis output
4. Share any error messages you encounter
